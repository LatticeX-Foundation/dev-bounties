# Developer Bounty Program(Phase 1)

PlatON is a new generation of privacy-preserving AI network initiated and driven by the LatticeX Foundation, and is also an open-source community project. Such a huge infrastructure requires joint effort from community developers. 

To encourage community developers to get more involved in the development and design of core infrastructure, the LatticeX Foundation launched the first phase of Developer Bounty Program to reward those who provide basic services for PlatON and Alaya.



## Details of the First Phase of Developer Bounty Program

### Bounty #1: Review code and submit issues found in the code

**Requirements:**

Only clear, accurate descriptions of the issues, their impact, and plans for repairing them are deemed valid feedback.

**Bounty rules:**

- The issues in code submitted will be rated (Low, Medium, or High) by the community project maintenance team, and LAT equivalent to 50 USDT~1,000 USDT will be allocated according to the issue level.
- In the case of same issues submitted by more than one developer, the first submitter who meets the requirements will be rewarded. 



### Bounty #2: Fix bugs and the optimize features
