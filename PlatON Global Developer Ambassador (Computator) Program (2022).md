# PlatON Global Developer Ambassador (Computator) Program (2022)

Along with the release of the PlatON 2.0 whitepaper, PlatON has officially entered the 2.0 era as a decentralized privacy-preserving AI network.

Combining blockchain and privacy-preserving computation technologies, PlatON is building a decentralized and collaborative AI network and global brain to drive the democratization of AI for safe artificial general intelligence.

Backed by the LatticeX Foundation’s Computator Fund, the PlatON Global Developer Ambassador Program has officially started its recruitment to allow developers from all regions to join the building of a “smart network” and expand the protocol’s global influence and recognition while achieving its mission. Your help will be key to PlatON’s growth in local developer communities.



## Our Ambassador Program

The PlatON Global Developer Ambassador Program aims to identify PlatON-loving technology and ecosystem leaders for the protocol’s open-source community. If you wish to become a PlatON Global Developer Ambassador, we expect you to be familiar with PlatON and recognize our mission. Meanwhile, PlatON Ambassadors should popularize PlatON’s technological concepts in local markets with great passion and encourage new developers and companies to contribute to the building of the PlatON ecosystem.



## What We Can Offer

As an official PlatON Ambassador, you could get:

- **Funding support:** You could get performance-based incentives and allowances, as well as a budget for community building.
- **Extensive access to PlatON:** You will have a chance to work with PlatON’s key developer team, receive product & technology training, and get deeply involved in the development of PlatON’s core protocol.
- **Developer community governance:** An outstanding Ambassador could participate in the governance of PlatON open-source technology community as its maintainer and become a member of the Project Management Committee (PMC).
- **Support for project incubation:** Ambassadors enjoy priority access to PlatON’s support for project incubation. At PlatON, you could facilitate the implementation of various creative insights as a key player.

At PlatON, you will get a rewarding experience. While meeting strong partners and building personal networks, you’ll be one of the first pioneers to witness the birth of a “smart network”.



## Ambassador Levels & Upgrade Mechanism
