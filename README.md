## Developer Bounty Program

PlatON is a new generation of privacy-preserving AI network initiated and driven by the LatticeX Foundation, and is also an open-source community project. Such a huge infrastructure requires joint effort from community developers. 

To encourage community developers to get more involved in the development and design of core infrastructure, the LatticeX Foundation launched Developer Bounty Program to reward those who provide basic services for PlatON and Alaya.
