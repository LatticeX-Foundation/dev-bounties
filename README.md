# PlatON Developer Program

PlatON is a new generation of privacy-preserving AI network initiated and driven by the LatticeX Foundation, and is also an open-source community project. Such a huge infrastructure requires joint effort from community developers. 



## :fire: PlatON Global Developer Ambassador Program

Backed by the LatticeX Foundation’s Computator Fund, the PlatON Global Developer Ambassador Program has officially started its recruitment to allow developers from all regions to join the building of a “smart network” and expand the protocol’s global influence and recognition while achieving its mission. Your help will be key to PlatON’s growth in local developer communities.

## Developer Bounty Program

To encourage community developers to get more involved in the development and design of core infrastructure, the LatticeX Foundation launched Developer Bounty Program to reward those who provide basic services for PlatON and Alaya.
